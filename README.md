This is just a small test application I did to try out GraphQL.

You'll find a react client that can READ from either one of the local servers or an external server.

**Clients**
- React client in `frontend` folder

**Servers**
- Go server in `backend-go`
- Node server in `backend-node`
- Node server that's wrapping an external REST in `backend-node-wrapping-rest`
